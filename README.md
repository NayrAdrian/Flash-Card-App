- After 3 seconds, The card will flip and the English word will be shown, The user should click the "X" button to generate a new card.
- If the user managed to answer the right English word before the card flipped, The user can click the "✓" button.
- Once the "✓" button is clicked, The word is removed and will not be shown once the user generates a new card.
- The goal of the flashcard app is only to test the words the user doesn't know.
